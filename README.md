# C Data Structures
> Author: Sakarias Lilja

## Description
This program was made with the sole purpose to practice the declaration of the most common data structures present in programming. 

The code will not be copied from elsewhere, with the possible exception regarding the test-cases.

The data structures will not be made to work with all values with the use of pointers, instead they will be made to work with integers and have in-built print methods (may be subjected to change).

Performance of the data structures is measured in ms.
